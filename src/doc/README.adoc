// - Moreover, the built-in Viewpoints of ArchiCode have been designed to generate synthetic relationships. So that, views are never polluted by sibling relationships.

ArchiCode advocates an architectural design philosophy characterized by incremental refinement and in-depth exploration. This approach empowers architects to craft well-structured and comprehensive designs that capture the essence of architectural vision. Let's delve into the tenets of this methodology:

- Iterative Refinement: In the journey of architectural creation, ArchiCode encourages an iterative process. The model evolves incrementally, starting from the highest levels of abstraction and cascading down to the minutiae of detail. This iterative refinement ensures a nuanced and coherent architectural representation.

- Layered Depth: With each iteration, the model's depth is progressively enriched. As elements are introduced, relationships between them are also refined, layer by layer. This gradual deepening ensures that architectural intricacies are meticulously captured, leading to a holistic and accurate depiction.

- Relationship Refinement: Just as elements undergo iterative enhancements, relationships between them also follow the same iterative path. The relationships are fine-tuned and perfected, aligning with the evolving architectural narrative.

- Clarity in Relationship Hierarchy: ArchiCode empowers architects to prune relationships for clarity. In instances where higher-level relationships are encompassed by those of lower levels, these higher-level relationships can be refined or omitted, ensuring that the architectural landscape remains lucid and uncluttered.

- Synthetic Relationship Generation: A distinctive feature of ArchiCode's built-in Viewpoints lies in their ability to generate synthetic relationships. This intentional design prevents sibling relationships from infiltrating the views, preserving the purity and coherence of each view's focus.

By embracing ArchiCode's incremental and in-depth design approach, architects embark on a transformative journey of iterative refinement. This methodology ensures that architectural designs are not only comprehensive but also well-structured, intelligible, and unburdened by unnecessary clutter.

==== Example: An ecommerce platform

===== Introduction

// - The example depicts the process to iteratively design and refine the model of an ecommerce platform.

In the realm of software architecture, ArchiCode stands as a versatile tool that facilitates the systematic design and refinement of intricate systems. In this example, we embark on an iterative journey to architect an e-commerce platform, revealing how ArchiCode empowers architects to create coherent and well-defined architectural models. We commence by identifying high-level elements and relationships, progressively breaking down the system into specialized containers and interactions. Notably, while the outlined steps establish a structured foundation, ArchiCode's true strength lies in its adaptability, enabling architects to customize the process to fit the unique demands of their projects. As we delve into this exploration, ArchiCode emerges as a dynamic instrument, empowering architects to craft intricate architectural designs that seamlessly connect vision with implementation.

===== Step #1: Shape the highest elements of the application layer

// - The first task is to identity the highest elements of the application layer.
//   - We have the platform it-self, named EcommercePlatform, identified as a Solution.
//   - We have the users, named User, for whom the platform is for.
//   - We have the social identity providers, named SocialIdentityProvider, like Google, Microsoft ...
//   - We have the payment gateway, named PaymentGateway, like Stripe, Braintree ...

In this initial step, we identify the foundational elements of the application layer:

- EcommercePlatform: At the core of the system, "EcommercePlatform" is identified as the solution itself, representing the entire e-commerce platform.

- User: This element represents the users who interact with the e-commerce platform, browse products, and make purchases.

- SocialIdentityProvider: External services such as Google and Microsoft are designated as "SocialIdentityProvider," responsible for authenticating users.

- PaymentGateway: The element symbolizes external payment processing services like Stripe and Braintree that facilitate secure financial transactions.

.Step #1 - The addition of the elements in `workspace.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
include::examples/design_example_step_1/workspace_element.yaml[]
----

// - The second task is to identity the relationships between the elements,
//   - User uses the platforms, so we create the relationship from User to EcommercePlatform.
//   - The platform leverages on external social identity providers, so we create the relationship from EcommercePlatform to SocialIdentityProvider.
//   - The platform leverages on payment gateway, so we create the relationship from EcommercePlatform to PaymentGateway.

Once the elements are identified, we design the relationships between them:

- User uses EcommercePlatform: A direct relationship is established from the "User" element to the "EcommercePlatform" element. This relationship signifies that users engage with the platform to explore products, make purchases, and manage their accounts.

- EcommercePlatform leverages SocialIdentityProvider: A relationship is created from "EcommercePlatform" to "SocialIdentityProvider" to depict the platform's reliance on external authentication services. This connection ensures a seamless and secure login process for users through trusted identity providers.

- EcommercePlatform leverages PaymentGateway: Another relationship is formed from "EcommercePlatform" to "PaymentGateway" to illustrate the platform's integration with external payment processing services. Through this relationship, the platform enables customers to complete transactions using various payment methods.

.Step #1 - The addition of the relationships in `workspace.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
include::examples/design_example_step_1/workspace_element.yaml[]
----

// - Finally, a first generation of views can be done.
//   - At this level of abstraction, the Overview viewpoint is the most suitable.
//   - The viewpoints shows the Ingress and Egress relationships of a given element.
//   - ArchiCode smartly generates a view for each element of the model.

After establishing the relationships, the next task involves generating a first generation of views:

- Overview Viewpoint: At this level of abstraction, the "Overview" viewpoint is the most suitable. This viewpoint provides a broad perspective of the relationships and interactions related to the e-commerce platform.

- Ingress and Egress Relationships: The viewpoint showcases the "Ingress" relationships, highlighting how elements such as "User" enter the platform. Additionally, it depicts "Egress" relationships, illustrating how the platform  interact with dependencies.

.Step #1 - Generate the "Overview" views
[source,shell]
----
archicode views generate --viewpoint=overview
----

The command generates four Plantuml files in the `./views/plantuml/application` folder:

- `EcommercePlatform_overview.puml`
- `PaymentGateway_overview.puml`
- `SocialIdentityProvider_overview.puml`
- `User_overview.puml`

The view `EcommercePlatform_overview.puml` is built upon the "Overview" viewpoint and focus on the Ingress and Egress relationships where the `EcommercePlatform` element is involved.

.Step #1 - The overview of the ecommerce platform
[plantuml, EcommercePlatform_overview]
----
include::examples/design_example_step_1/views/plantuml/application/EcommercePlatform_overview.puml[]
----

The view `PaymentGateway_overview.puml` is built upon the "Overview" viewpoint and focus on the Ingress and Egress relationships where the `PaymentGateway` element is involved.

.Step #1 - The overview of the payment gateway
[plantuml, PaymentGateway_overview]
----
include::examples/design_example_step_1/views/plantuml/application/PaymentGateway_overview.puml[]
----

The concept is similar for the others generated views.

This initial step established a clear foundation by identifying the key elements and relationships within the e-commerce platform's application layer.

===== Step #2: Identify the systems of the solution

// - The second step focus on the systems composing the platform and the underlying relationships.
// - The first task is the decomposition of the EcommercePlatform Solution in System elements.
// - The second task is the design of the relationships between the Systems elements of the EcommercePlatform Solution element.
// - The third task is the refinement of the Ingress and Egress relationships of the EcommercePlatform Solution element to replace it by one of the System elements.
// - Then, the generation of the views can be done. At this level of abstraction, the Detailed viewpoint is the most suitable. The Viewpoint shows the Ingress and Egress relationships on children of a given element.

In this step, we delve deeper into the systems that compose the e-commerce platform and establish relationships between them.

The first task involves breaking down the "EcommercePlatform" Solution into distinct "System" elements, each responsible for specific functionalities:

- Product Catalog: Manages product categorization, listings, and details.

- User Management: Handles user authentication, profiles, and preferences.

- Order Processing: Facilitates order creation, payment processing, and order tracking.

- Content Management: Manages website content, including product descriptions and promotional banners.

- User Interface: Provides personalized product recommendations based on user behavior.

.Step #2 - The addition of the system elements in `workspace.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
include::examples/design_example_step_2/workspace_element.yaml[]
----

The second task focuses on designing relationships between the newly defined "System" elements:

- User Interface → Product Catalog: The "User Interface" system interacts with the "Product Catalog" system to present products to users and allow browsing and selection.

- User Interface → User Management: The "User Interface" system communicates with the "User Management" system to manage user authentication and profile-related interactions.

- User Interface → Order Processing: The "User Interface" system connects with the "Order Processing" system to handle order creation and transaction processing.

- User Interface → Content Management: The "User Interface" system engages with the "Content Management" system to display dynamic website content to users.

- User Management → Social Identity Provider: The "User Management" system integrates with external "Social Identity Providers" to ensure secure user authentication and identity verification.

- Order Processing → Product Catalog: The "Order Processing" system collaborates with the "Product Catalog" system to validate product availability and manage order-related information.

- Order Processing → Payment Gateway: The "Order Processing" system interfaces with external "Payment Gateway" services to facilitate secure payment processing and transaction completion.

.Step #2 - The addition of the relationships in `workspace.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
include::examples/design_example_step_2/workspace_relationship.yaml[]
----

In the third task, we refine the "Ingress" and "Egress" relationships of the "EcommercePlatform" Solution element to enhance clarity and streamline the representation:

- The "Ingress" relationship from "User" can be removed, as it is now covered by the "User Interface" system. User interactions with the authentication and profile management, catalogs, ordering or content functionalities are now directed to the "User Interface" system.

- The "Egress" relationship from the "EcommercePlatform" to "Social Identity Provider" can be removed, as it is now covered by the "User Management" system's integration with "Social Identity Providers" for secure user authentication and identity verification.

- The "Egress" relationship from the "EcommercePlatform" to "Payment Gateway" can be removed, as it is now covered by the "Order Processing" system's interaction with external "Payment Gateway" services for secure payment processing and transaction completion.

.Step #2 - The removal of useless relationships in `workspace.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
include::examples/design_example_step_2/workspace_refined.yaml[]
----

Upon refining relationships and elements, we generate detailed views using the "Detailed" viewpoint:

- Detailed Viewpoint: At this level of abstraction, the "Detailed" viewpoint is most suitable. It provides an in-depth exploration of the interactions between child elements within a given parent element.

- Ingress and Egress Relationships: The viewpoint showcases the "Ingress" and "Egress" relationships within each "System" element, providing a comprehensive understanding of how functionalities and data flow between systems.

.Step #2 - Generate the "Overview" and "Detailed" views
[source,shell]
----
archicode views generate --viewpoint=overview --viewpoint=detailed
----

The command generates the additional Plantuml files in the `./views/plantuml/application` folder.

- `EcommercePlatform.ContentManagement_overview.puml`
- `EcommercePlatform.OrderProcessing_overview.puml`
- `EcommercePlatform.ProductCatalog_overview.puml`
- `EcommercePlatform.UserInterface_overview.puml`
- `EcommercePlatform.UserManagement_overview.puml`
- `EcommercePlatform_detailed.puml`

The view `EcommercePlatform_detailed.puml` is built upon the "Detailed" viewpoint and focus on the Ingress and Egress relationships where the children of the `EcommercePlatform` element are involved.

.Step #2 - The detailed of the ecommerce platform
[plantuml, EcommercePlatform_detailed]
----
include::examples/design_example_step_2/views/plantuml/application/EcommercePlatform_detailed.puml[]
----

The view `EcommercePlatform.UserInterface_overview.puml` is built upon the "Overview" viewpoint and focus on the Ingress and Egress relationships of the `UserInterface` element.


.Step #2 - The overview of the user interface
[plantuml, EcommercePlatform.UserInterface_overview]
----
include::examples/design_example_step_2/views/plantuml/application/EcommercePlatform.UserInterface_overview.puml[]
----

The view `EcommercePlatform_overview.puml` is still available but the drawn relationships are now synthetic ones.

.Step #2 - The overview of the ecommerce platform with synthetic relationships
[plantuml, EcommercePlatform_overview_synthetic]
----
include::examples/design_example_step_2/views/plantuml/application/EcommercePlatform_overview.puml[]
----

The second step focused on the intricate composition of systems within the e-commerce platform and the establishment of relationships between them.

===== Step #3: Deep dive into User Management

// - The third step focuses on the containers composing the platform's systems and the underlying relationships. In this example, we focus only on User Management.
// - The first task is the decomposition of the UserManagement System in Container elements.
// - The second task is the design of the relationships between the Container elements of the UserManagement System element.
// - The third task is the refinement of the Ingress and Egress relationships of the UserManagement System element to replace it by ones of the Container elements.
// - Then, the generation of the views can be done. At this level of abstraction, the Deep viewpoint can be used . The Viewpoint shows the Ingress and Egress relationships on descendants of a given element.

In this step, we shift our focus to the containers that compose the platform's systems, starting with the "User Management" system, and establish relationships between them.

The first task involves decomposing the "UserManagement" System into distinct "Container" elements, each responsible for specific functionalities:

- IdentityAndAccessManagement Container: Manages user authentication, login processes, and role-based access control.

- UserProfile Container: Handles user profile management, including personal information, preferences, and settings.

- UserProfile Database: Stores and manages user profile data, providing a reliable data source for the UserProfile Container.

.Step #3 - The addition container elements in `workspace.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
include::examples/design_example_step_3/workspace_element.yaml[]
----

The second task focuses on designing relationships between the newly defined "Container" elements:

- IdentityAndAccessManagement → UserProfileService: The "IdentityAndAccessManagement" Container communicates with the "UserProfileService" Container to provide access to user profile information after successful authentication.

- UserProfileService → UserProfileDatabase: The "UserProfileService" Container interacts with the "UserProfileDatabase" to store and retrieve user profile data.

.Step #3 - The addition container elements in `workspace.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
include::examples/design_example_step_3/workspace_relationship.yaml[]
----

In the third task, we refine the "Ingress" and "Egress" relationships of the "UserManagement" System element to enhance clarity and streamline the representation:

- The "Ingress" relationship from "UserInterface" to "UserManagement" is refined to become "UserInterface" → "UserProfileService". This change reflects the more granular interaction between the "UserInterface" and the dedicated "UserProfileService" container, specifically designed to handle user profile-related operations.

- The "Egress" relationship from "UserManagement" to "SocialIdentityProvider" is refined to become "IdentityAndAccessManagement" → "SocialIdentityProvider". This adjustment aligns with the system's architecture, where the "IdentityAndAccessManagement" container handles interactions with "Social Identity Providers" for secure user authentication and identity verification.

.Step #3 - The addition container elements in `workspace.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
include::examples/design_example_step_3/workspace_refined.yaml[]
----

Upon refining relationships and elements, we generate detailed views using the "Deep" viewpoint:

- Deep Viewpoint: At this level of abstraction, the "Deep" viewpoint is relevant. It provides an exploration of the "Ingress" and "Egress" relationships on descendants of a given element, offering a comprehensive understanding of interactions within the system.

- Ingress and Egress Relationships: The viewpoint showcases the "Ingress" and "Egress" relationships within each "Container" element of the "UserManagement" System, providing detailed insights into how functionalities and data flow within the system.

.Step #3 - Generate the views of all viewpoints
[source,shell]
----
archicode views generate
----

The command generates many Plantuml files in the `./views/plantuml/application` folder.

The view `EcommercePlatform_deep.puml` is built upon the "Deep" viewpoint and focus on the Ingress and Egress relationships involving the descendants of the `EcommercePlatform` element.

.Step #3 - The deepness of the ecommerce platform
[plantuml, EcommercePlatform_deep]
----
include::examples/design_example_step_3/views/plantuml/application/EcommercePlatform_deep.puml[]
----

The view `EcommercePlatform.UserManagement_detailed.puml` is built upon the "Detailed" viewpoint and focus on the Ingress and Egress relationships involving the children of the `UserManagement` element.

.Step #3 - The detailed of the User Management
[plantuml, EcommercePlatform.UserManagement_detailed]
----
include::examples/design_example_step_3/views/plantuml/application/EcommercePlatform.UserManagement_detailed.puml[]
----

The third step focused on the composition of containers within the "User Management" system, the establishment of relationships between them as well as the refinement of existing relationships.

=== Source Code Organization

// - The best practices to organize the source code of a project using the tool ArchiCode.
// - ArchiCode works with workspace file.
// - The workspace centralizes the data, by default the name is `workspace.yaml`.
// - As the content of workspace file grows, the management of the file becomes complicated.
// - Therefore, the manifest concept have been designed to solve big fat workspace files.
// - A manifest represents a single resource.
// - By default, ArchiCode discover manifests located in the folder "manifests" sibling to the workspace file.

Efficiently organizing your source code is a cornerstone of successful architectural endeavors, and ArchiCode is your companion in this journey. Let's delve into the best practices for structuring your source code using ArchiCode:

- Workspace Dynamics: The workspace file, named `workspace.yaml` by default, serves as a centralized repository for your architectural data.

- Scaling Challenges: As your architectural vision flourishes, the workspace file's contents may expand, leading to management complexities. Recognizing the need for efficient management, ArchiCode introduces the concept of manifests. A manifest embodies a singular architectural resource, enabling focused and structured representation. With manifests, ArchiCode empowers you to break down complex elements into distinct resources, enhancing manageability and granularity. ArchiCode streamlines the process of manifest discovery by default. It effortlessly detects manifests residing in the "manifests" folder, positioned as a sibling to the workspace file.

.Example of an ArchiCode project directory
